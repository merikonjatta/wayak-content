<para>The animal on the cover of <emphasis>Linux Kernel in a Nutshell</emphasis> is a cup coral (<emphasis>Balanophyllia elegans</emphasis>). Most commonly found on or under shaded rocks, cup corals range from British Columbia to Baja, California. Cup corals are generally orange in color, with lighter orange tentacles extending out from the stony skeleton base.</para>
<para>Cup corals are armed with tentacles that have clusters of poisoning stingers called spirocysts, which they use to prey on passing plankton. Once plankton is captured, the coral will use its tentacles to draw the food into its stomach. Cup corals also use their tentacles to attach themselves to rocks.</para>
